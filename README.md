## WebRTC 1.0: Real-time Communication Between Browsers

This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to allow media to be
sent to and received from another browser or device implementing the appropriate
set of real-time protocols. This specification is being developed in conjunction
with a protocol specification developed by the IETF RTCWEB group and an API
specification to get access to local media devices developed by the Media
Capture Task Force.
